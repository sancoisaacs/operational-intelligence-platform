# Operational Intelligence Platform

A suite of offline-first analytical engines engineered to transform raw operational, behavioral, and performance data into structured predictive intelligence.

---

## Overview
The Operational Intelligence Platform is a collection of self-contained decision systems designed to perform advanced analysis directly in the browser. Each tool eliminates dependency on servers, cloud services, or external infrastructure, enabling secure, instant insights even within restricted environments.

These systems are built to move teams from reactive troubleshooting to proactive decision-making.

---

## Mission
To compress **time-to-insight** by converting unstructured or siloed datasets into actionable intelligence through deterministic logic and client-side computation.

---

## Core Design Principles
- **Client-Side Execution** — All processing occurs locally in the browser
- **Zero Data Leakage** — No uploads, tracking, or external calls
- **Instant Analysis** — No loading queues or backend latency
- **Environment Resilience** — Fully functional in offline or locked-down systems
- **Deterministic First** — Logic engines operate independently of AI or APIs

---

## System Categories Included
- Predictive Analytics Engines
- KPI Intelligence Dashboards
- Biometric Correlation Systems
- Forensic Decision Engines
- Operational Simulators

---

## Technology Stack
Vanilla JavaScript • SQL.js (WASM SQLite) • Chart.js • SheetJS • Tailwind CSS

---

## Architectural Philosophy
These applications follow a **Single-File Intelligence System** model:
- no build step
- no installation
- no package managers
- no runtime dependencies

Each system is portable, inspectable, and executable as a standalone analytical engine.

---

## Portfolio Context
This repository is part of a broader internal tooling architecture portfolio demonstrating:

- Predictive modeling
- Root cause automation
- Operational simulation
- Data-driven decision engineering
