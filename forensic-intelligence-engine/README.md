**Multi-factor analytics engine for decision intelligence**  
Operational Analysis • Predictive Insight • Zero Infrastructure

---

## What It Does
This application converts raw datasets into structured intelligence, enabling users to identify patterns, evaluate risk, and generate actionable strategic recommendations instantly.

---

## Problem It Solves
Operational data is often fragmented, noisy, or too large to interpret manually.  
Traditional analytics tools require setup, connectivity, or backend infrastructure.

• Data exists but insight is delayed  
• Tools are heavy or restricted  
• Decisions must be made quickly  

This system removes friction between **data and decision**.

## Core Capabilities

- Multi-file dataset ingestion (CSV, XLSX)
- Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- Predictive modeling with regression logic
- Risk scoring matrix
- Cross-variable correlation analysis
- Strategic recommendation engine
- Forecast simulation
- Export to PDF, Excel, CSV

---

## How It Works

1. User inputs datasets
2. Intelligence engine parses and analyzes data
3. Models calculate patterns, correlations, and risk
4. System produces insights and recommendations
